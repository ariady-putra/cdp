## This is a sample of `HOME` directory
The shell scripts ([`runcpreprod.sh`](runcpreprod.sh), [`runcpreview.sh`](runcpreview.sh), and [`runct.sh`](runct.sh)) will write some configuration files when executed, which then will be read by the [`cdp`](../../../) Node.js web app.<br/><br/>
The folder `.local/share/applications/` contains the desktop/application shortcuts pointing to the aforementioned executable shell scripts, where `.local/bin/` contains various versions of `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` (not included in this project, please refer to [input-output-hk/cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node)).
