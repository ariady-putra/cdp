## This is a sample of `HOME` directory
The shell scripts (`runcpreprod.sh`, `runcpreview.sh`, and`runct.sh`) will write some configuration files when executed, which then will be read by the `cdp` Node.js web app.<br/>
The folder `.local/share/applications/` contains the desktop/application shortcuts pointing to the aforementioned executable shell scripts, where `.local/bin/` contains various versions of `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` (not included in this project, please refer to [input-output-hk/cardano-node](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-node)).
